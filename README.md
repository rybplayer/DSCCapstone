# Lack of code
As we are studying the theoretical lower bounds for various protocals in the
field of communication complexity, we have not written any code for this
project. Our work consists instead (at this point) of exercises that we have
done, meant to help develop the skills to prove lower bounds that we will use
during quarter 2.
