# Communication Complexity for Data Science
Files for UCSD DSC Capstone section A13: Communication Complexity.

# 📝 General Information

## 💻 Lack of Code Disclaimer
As we are studying the theoretical lower bounds for various protocals in the
field of communication complexity, we have not written any code for this
project. Our work consists instead of exercises and notes that we have
done, meant to help develop the skills necessary to do both of our projects.

## 1️⃣ Quarter 1 Project
For our quarter 1 project, we present a survey on the applications of communication 
complexity for various application fields, like agents in reinforcement learning, 
cryptography, game theory, and data structures.

This report is available in [q1_project.pdf](q1_project.pdf).

## 2️⃣ Quarter 2 Project
For our quarter 2 project, we will be diving deeper into one area from our Quarter 1
project, with the goal of attempting novel, original research at the frontier of the field. 
The area we will be focusing on is TBD.
