\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, communication complexity provides a flexible framework to prove bounds, construct algorithms, and analyze problems in a range of applicable fields. Though theoretical in nature, assuming infinite compute power from its players, the model is suprisingly applicable, with plenty of optimality proofs, algorithms, and insights that would be difficult to prove using other tools.
