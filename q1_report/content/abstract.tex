Communication complexity studies the asymptotic communication bounds of various models of communication. The concept of communication is universal among computing: many problems in cryptography, distributed computing, game theory, and multi-agent learning, among many others, can be framed in terms of communication. In this report we survey the applications of communication complexity for a variety of fields, examining the fundamental communication problems in each and their lower and upper bounds.
