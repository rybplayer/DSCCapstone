\subsection{Problem 1.6}
	\begin{proof}
		fooling set of $\log n$ intervals, which cover all of $n$. Which blocks are in
		$X \cup Y$ determines median, and there are $2^{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ arrangement
		of blocks, so requres at least $\frac{n}{\log n}$ to determine which
		arrangement and therefore which median is correct.
	\end{proof}
