\begin{exercise}[4.1]
Suppose there are $k$ parties in the number-on-forehead model. The $i$th party has the bit $X_i \in {0,1}$ written on their forehead, and $X_1, \ldots, X_k$ are sampled independently and uniformly at random. Show that there is a protocol for each party to privately write down a guess for the bit on their own forehead, without \emph{any} communication, in such a way that the probability that all parties guess correctly is $1/2$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k \in \{0,1\}$ be independent and uniformly random bits. 
In the number-on-forehead model, the $i$-th player sees all bits except $X_i$ 
and must guess that value.

We use the protocol below to guess the value of $X_i$:
\[
g_i = \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2,
\]

The condition for our guess to be correct is then,
\[
X_i = \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2
\]

We can determine whether or not the sum of all bits is zero by the following equation:
\[
X_i + \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2 = 0
\]

Which is the same as:
\[
X_i = \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2
\]

Therefore, we know that $X_i$ = $g_i$ only if the sum of all bits is even.Given that $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k \in \{0,1\}$ are independent and uniformly random bits there are $2^k$ unique bytes, assuming $k \ge 1$, we know that $2^{k-1}$ of the unique bytes sum to an even number. This results in:
\[
P(Correct) = \frac{\textbf{number of bytes with even sums}}{\textbf{total number of bytes}} = \frac{2^{k-1}}{2^k} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\end{proof}
