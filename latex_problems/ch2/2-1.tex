\subsection*{Exercise 2.1}

\begin{exercise}[2.1]
Show that there is a matrix whose rank is $1$, yet its communication complexity is $2$. Conclude that $+1$ is necessary in "The communication complexity of $M$ is at most $\text{rank}(M) + 1$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
Take $M = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$. It has rank $1$ but clearly takes 2 bits of communication.
\end{proof}
