\subsection*{Problem 1.6}
	\begin{proof}
		We take the set $[n]$, and divide it into $\log n$
		non-overlapping continuous intervals. We know then that the
		combination of intervals which fall into $X \cup Y$ will then
		determine the median of the set. Since there are
		$2^{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ possible intervals, it will take
		$\omega(\log 2^{\frac{n}{\log n}}) = \Omega(\frac{n}{\log
		{n}})$
	\end{proof}
