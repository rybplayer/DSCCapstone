\section*{Exercise 1.6}

\begin{exercise}[1.6]
Recall the protocol for the median of two lists discussed in the introduction. Consider the following varaint of the median problem. Alice is given a set $X \subseteq [n]$, Bob is given a set $Y \subseteq [n]$, and their goal is to compute the median of the set $X \cup Y$. The difference here is that we take the union as sets, so there are no repetitions. Show that the communication complexity of this problem is at least $\Omega(n / \log n)$. \emph{Hint: Compute the median of the union of sets, as well as the union of sets.}
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
    We take the set $[n]$, and divide it into $\log n$
    non-overlapping continuous intervals. We know then that the
    combination of intervals which fall into $X \cup Y$ will then
    determine the median of the set. Since there are
    $2^{\frac{n}{\log n}}$ possible intervals, it will take
    $\omega(\log 2^{\frac{n}{\log n}}) = \Omega(\frac{n}{\log
    {n}})$
\end{proof}
