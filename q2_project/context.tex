\section{Context}
Communication complexity involves the study of how much \textit{communication} is needed for multiple parties to jointly compute a function where each party's input is limited. This field is fundamentally different from time complexity as it only seeks to determine how many \textit{bits} need to be exchanged to compute a protocol. At its core, communication complexity seeks to determine how difficult it is to compute a function where information is spread out across multiple parties. The study of communication complexity draws upon all facets of math to determine new lower bounds.

In our project we will seek to apply communication complexity to a real-world problem.
