We propose a 7-week project on investigating the lower bounds for communication between agents traversing a given graph. We begin with a hyper-constrained version of the problem to prove the feasibility of the project. We propose extending this model of multi-agent traversal for the project to create increasingly applicable bounds for communication in applications like self-driving cars, multi-agent search problems, transport, and other similar problems. Project deliverables include a paper with formal proofs of our claims and a poster presentation aimed at a more general, applied audience.
