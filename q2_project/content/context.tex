Communication complexity involves the study of how much \textit{communication} is needed for multiple parties to jointly compute a function where each party's input is limited. This field is fundamentally different from time complexity as it only seeks to determine how many \textit{bits} need to be exchanged to compute a protocol. In fact, communication complexity may assume its parties each have access to infinite compute resources; we only care about the communication between them.

At its core, communication complexity seeks to determine how difficult it is to compute a function where information is spread out across multiple parties. In our project we will seek to apply communication complexity to a real-world problem, namely that of multi-agent traversal.
