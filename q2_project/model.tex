\section{Model}

We take a grid, upon which there are agents which wish to traverse to their
destination. We wish to use this model to find the minimum communication
required for each agent to arrive at it's destination. We make the following
assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each agent has a pre-defined endpoint
	\item The agents each wish to minimize the number of edges traversed to reach their destination
	\item Each agent must move
	\item The graph edges have no weights
	\item There are no obstacles. In other words, each agent can traverse any edge freely
	\item Each agent has full knowledge of the grid
	\item All agent start and end points are unique
	\item The agents are traversing a grid
	\item There exits a shared random string
	\item All agents move 1 edge at a time
	\item There are 2 agents
	\item The map is known in advance of the algorithm's design
	\item All agents can communicate
\end{enumerate}
