\begin{proof}
Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k \in \{0,1\}$ be independent and uniformly random bits. 
In the number-on-forehead model, the $i$-th player sees all bits except $X_i$ 
and must guess that value.

We use the protocol below to guess the value of $X_i$:
\[
g_i = \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2,
\]

The condition for our guess to be correct is then,
\[
X_i = \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2
\]

We can determine whether or not the sum of all bits is zero by the following equation:
\[
X_i + \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2 = 0
\]

Which is the same as:
\[
X_i = \sum_{j \ne i}^{k}X_j \mod 2
\]

Therfore, we know that $X_i$ = $g_i$ only if the sum of all bits is even.

Given that $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_k \in \{0,1\}$ are independent and uniformly random bits
there are $2^k$ unique bytes, assuming $k \ge 1$, we know that $2^{k-1}$ of the unique bytes
sum to an even number.

Resulting in:
\[
P(Correct) = \frac{\textbf{number of bytes with even sums}}{\textbf{total number of bytes}} = \frac{2^{k-1}}{2^k} = \frac{1}{2}
\]


\end{proof}
